Module containing various machine learning/AI models that can be created, trained, and deployed.

### Decision Tree
A model that uses a binary tree to make decisions after being trained on the dataset. A decision tree contains nodes that break down the dataset based on its features. When a decision tree is built during its training, nodes are split into child nodes based on a particular threshold value of a feature being used to decide whether to split the node or not. The leaf nodes of the decision tree are the final decision points where the tree predicts the class of the data. Decision trees can be used for classification or regression.

Details:
- **TreeNode**: Class for creating a tree node within a decision tree.
